    "Note that the negative gradient of f(x) points in the steepest descent direction, $-\\nabla f$. Anything descent direction that forms an angle less then $\\pi/2$ will still descend, given the step size, $\\episilon$, is small. (Remember that the gradient is perpindicular to the level curves of a function, see book image for more intuition. Proof is simple as well). \n",
